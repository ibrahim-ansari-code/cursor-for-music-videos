I'm having an issue where my Gumloop pipeline isn't using the image_url I'm sending via the API.

PROBLEM:
- I'm POSTing to /api/v1/start_pipeline with body: {"image_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}
- Gumloop accepts the request (200 OK) and returns a run_id
- But the Ask AI node is returning the SAME content for different image URLs
- When I check the node's inputs/outputs, the image_url field shows as empty or not provided

MY PIPELINE SETUP:
- First node: Receives pipeline input
- Second node: Ask AI node with prompt that references {image_url} or {{image_url}}
- The Ask AI node has a default value box where I've configured image_url

QUESTIONS:
1. How do I configure the Ask AI node to receive the image_url from the pipeline input (not just use a default value)?
2. Should the image_url be in the pipeline's input schema/definition, or can it be passed directly in the POST body?
3. In the Ask AI node, should I reference {image_url} or {{image_url}} in the prompt?
4. Is there an "Inputs" or "Variables" section in the Ask AI node where I need to map pipeline inputs?
5. Why would Gumloop accept the request but not pass the image_url to the node?

Please help me diagnose why the image_url from the API request isn't reaching the Ask AI node.
