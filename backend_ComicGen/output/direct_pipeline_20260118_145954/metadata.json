After hundreds and hundreds of years of delivering presents every Christmas Eve, Santa woke one year and found he was tired. So very sleepy, yawned to Mrs. Claus, who was already up and doing her hair. Christmas was her favorite time of year, of course, and she liked to change hair colors every time. This year, she had settled on silver, like the stars, with blue bits, like the night sky she fancied Santa would soon be scooting across.",

He dragged himself up out of bed and started changing from his pajamas. But even when he was fully dressed and eating his breakfast, he fell asleep again. This time, in the hot cocoa.",

It said, \"Santa's napping. Be back next year.\" She also made copies and hung them on the workshop door and in the North Pole main street. The elves were so surprised.",
